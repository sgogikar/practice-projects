#methodology of how this is solved *really important to know
# the input we get is a string. example 23 i.e. position[0] and position[1]
# now split the string so that we end up with a horizontal and vertical position to where this mapping is marked as X
# considering input 23 Second Column 3rd Row
horizontal = int(position[0]) #2
vertical = int(position[1]) #3

#remember dirty_dozen example always the vertical position is considered. Becuase horizontal is [0]

# print(map[vertical])

#this will give you an IndexError: list index out of range because in our input 23. Vertical 3 will be considered.
# Clearly in the map = [row1, row2, row3] we only have indices 0,1 and 2 hence the index is out of range
# to resolve this issue

print(map[vertical-1]) # if (column) Vertical valuve matches 3, AS WE ONLY HAVE *** 3X3 COORDINATES!!!

#now in order to select a row valuve i.e. horizontal value

selected_row = map[vertical-1] #Once we gotten hold of the row 3 if the input is 23
# we are taking this value of the row and shift it down by 1 in order for it to work
# as all of our rows start with 0 index
selected_row[horizontal-1] = 'X'


#Write your code above this row 👆

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")

#put this in Thonny and understand it thoroughly!!!
