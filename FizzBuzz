#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡
#i absolutely love how i solved this smoothly. 
# simple conditions. 
# step1: as angela said use a singular form of your data, our data has numbers hence number 
# if that number is divisible by 3 it is fizz and if it is divisibly by 5 it is buzz, if both fizzbuzz and if nothing print number. 
# i did in in the same order got different results and hence i debugged the process flow and placed the and condition as my first condition. 

for number in range(1,101):
    if number%3 == 0 and number%5==0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif number%3==0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif number%5==0:
        print("Buzz")    
    else: 
        print(number)
